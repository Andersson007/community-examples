# This is an example of using the items2dict filter plugin.

# As input we have the list [{'key': 'string1', 'value': 'string2'}].
# We want to transform the list into a dictionary that have 'string1'
# as a key and string2 as its value.
# The following variable represents the list data before
# applying the items2dict filter plugin:
- name: Set the input list
  set_fact:
   input_list:
     - key: string1
       value: string2

# After applying the items2dict filter plugin, we expect to
# get a dictionary of the desired form:
- name: Transform list to dictionary using items2dict plugin
  set_fact:
    result_dict: '{{ input_list | items2dict(key_name="key", value_name="value") }}'

# Let's check if the result variable contains the data we want:
- name: Check the result
  assert:
    that:
      - result_dict['string1'] == 'string2'
